Cybersecurity Engineer by day. Newsletter strategist by night who transforms YouTube-dependent content creators into a $1M+ annual revenue media companies through strategic newsletters.

## Brand Promise

We help YouTube-dependent content creators get ownership of their audience by elimnating dependency on the YouTube algorithm, Terms of Service, or Community Guidelines. We develop closer relationships with their audience through educational email courses and/or newsletters. This helps create more greater and more reliable MRR.

## Positioning Statement

For established Sports YouTube content creators (100K+ subscribers) who understand algorithm dependency genuinely threatens their livelihood - this creates urgent need for our solution.  These creators are already earning $50K-$500K+ annually and understand the value of professional content services.

## Vision

## Visual Style (for scripting/titles/design)

* Black-and-white dominant palette with purple-blue cursor-inspired gradients
