**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Your copy of "The $180K Newsletter Mistake" is attached to this email. 

But before you dive in, I want to share something that's not in the guide...

Yesterday, I got an email from Marcus, one of the creators featured in the guide. His latest newsletter product launch just hit $89K in revenue. In 5 days.

Here's what he said:

*"Oliver, I can't believe how wrong I was about email marketing. I thought it was just another way to promote my YouTube videos. Your E.A.R.N. Framework completely changed my business. My subscribers aren't just watching anymore—they're buying."*

Marcus went from treating his email list like a billboard to treating it like a VIP community. The difference? $89K in 5 days.

**Here's what you'll discover in your guide:**

• Why 77% of YouTube creators are unknowingly sabotaging their newsletter revenue (page 4)
• The E.A.R.N. Framework that Sarah used to generate $127K in 72 hours (page 8)
• Case study breakdown: How one creator went from 31% to 71% open rates (page 15)
• The 7-email welcome sequence template that converts 67% of subscribers (page 19)
• Your 90-day roadmap to $15K in newsletter revenue (page 21)

**One quick favor:** After you read through the guide, hit reply and let me know your biggest takeaway. I read every response personally, and I often feature the best insights in my weekly newsletter.

Over the next two weeks, I'll be sharing some of my best strategies that didn't make it into the guide—including the exact email templates my $100K+ clients use and the automation workflows that run their businesses on autopilot.

Talk soon,

Oliver Wainwright  
*P.S. The biggest mistake I see creators make? They download guides like this and never implement them. Don't be that person. Pick ONE strategy from the guide and implement it this week. Your future self will thank you.*
