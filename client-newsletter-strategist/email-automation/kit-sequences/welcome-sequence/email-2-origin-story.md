**Subject Line:** How I accidentally built a $2M newsletter business

**Preview Text:** The YouTube creator who changed everything for me...

**Email Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I wasn't supposed to become a newsletter strategist.

My background is cybersecurity engineering. I was the guy building firewalls and analyzing network threats, not teaching creators how to monetize email lists.

But in 2022, everything changed because of one YouTube creator named Jake.

Jake had 280K subscribers in the college football space. Solid channel, great content, loyal audience. But he was struggling to monetize beyond YouTube ad revenue—which was unpredictable at best.

"I make $6K one month, $2K the next," he told me during a call. "I need something more stable."

I suggested he start an email newsletter. "I've tried that," he said. "I send weekly recaps of my videos. Nobody cares."

That's when I realized the problem.

**Jake was treating his email list like a YouTube audience.**

YouTube viewers want entertainment. Email subscribers want value they can't get anywhere else.

So we rebuilt his entire email strategy around what I now call the E.A.R.N. Framework:

**E - Exclusive content** that only existed in email  
**A - Actionable insights** his audience could implement immediately  
**R - Relationship building** through progressive value delivery  
**N - Nurture systems** that moved subscribers from free to paid

Within 6 months:
• His email list grew from 800 to 12,000 subscribers
• His open rates jumped from 23% to 71%
• He launched his first paid product and generated $127K in the first week
• His monthly newsletter revenue hit $47K (more than his best YouTube month ever)

Jake's success wasn't luck. It was strategy.

And when other creators started asking how he did it, I realized I'd accidentally discovered something bigger than a one-off success story.

**I'd found the blueprint for platform independence.**

Since then, I've helped 200+ creators implement variations of this system. They've collectively generated over $47M in newsletter revenue.

But here's what really matters:

They're not scared of algorithm changes anymore. They own their audiences. They control their revenue. They've built businesses that thrive regardless of what YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok decides to do next.

**That's what I want for you.**

Tomorrow, I'll share the biggest insight from working with all these creators—something that will completely change how you think about your audience.

Talk soon,

Oliver

*P.S. Jake just texted me that his newsletter hit $89K in monthly recurring revenue. From a guy who was worried about making $6K consistently. The E.A.R.N. Framework works when you work it.*
