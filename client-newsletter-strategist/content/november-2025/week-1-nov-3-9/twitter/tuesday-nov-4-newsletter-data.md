**Character Count:** 277

I analyzed 50 YouTube creators with 7-figure newsletters:

• Only 23% started email lists before 100K subs
• 89% who built million-dollar newsletters started at 25K subs
• Average first product launch: $127K
• Top performers: 67% email open rates vs 11% YouTube view rates

Data doesn't lie.

The magic ratio for newsletter success:

• 75% educational content
• 25% promotional content

**Character Count:** 273

Email delivers 6x better engagement than YouTube because it's permission-based marketing. When someone gives you their email, they're saying "I want to hear from you directly." That's worth more than any algorithm boost. That's a relationship you own.

## 3:30 PM PST - Format: Old vs New
**Character Count:** 246

Failing creators:

• Start email lists at 100K+ subs
• Wait for "perfect timing"
• Focus only on platform growth

Successful creators:

• Start collecting emails at 25K subs
• Build while they have momentum
• Own their audience relationships

Start early.
