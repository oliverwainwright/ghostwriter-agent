## Prolific Quality Output
When "generate content outlines/placeholders" is prompted, please prepare new files for each of the following platforms. 

    1. LinkedIn - 6 posts/week
    2. Twitter - 2 posts/day
    3. Substack - 2 posts/week
    4. YouTube - 3 videos/week
    5. Kit Email - 1/day

The goal is to start with LinkedIn and Twitter. 
Each week, we'll analyze the results from the interest with Our audience on the short-form platforms (in order to create the larger assets, AKA YouTube and Substack). The Kit email will serve similarly to LinkedIn and Twitter. With a daily email, just copywriting and keeping people engaged to see if people like being on the list.

Referencing the post that I point you to in our document, we will build the long-form content off of the best hits from our short-form iteration from the previous one or two weeks.

Generate one new file for each post, name it after the day, and then we will give it a title based on the topic that we need to write about or post about.

## Brand Reference
if we don't have content we're basing the content off of, reference @brand.md
